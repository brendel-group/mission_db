## Frontend Setup
1. **Install Node.js (if needed)**
   - If `npm` is not available on your system, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). This will include `npm`.

2. **Install Project Dependencies**
   - Once Node.js is installed, navigate to the frontend directory and run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This command will download and set up all necessary dependencies for the project.

2. **Start the Web Server**
   - Start the web server by typing:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
